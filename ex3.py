# Exercise 3 from Learn Python the hard way

# print out "I will now count my chickens:"
print("I will now count my chickens:")

# print out "Hens" and the result of 25 + 30 / 6. Same below
print("Hens", 25 + 30 / 6)
print("Roosters", 100 - 25 * 3 % 4)

# print out "Now I will count the eggs:"
print("Now I will count the eggs:")

# print out the result of calculating 3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 2 - 1 / 4 + 6
print(3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 2 - 1 / 4 + 6)

# print out "Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7?"
print("Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7?")

# print out the logical result of whether 3 + 2 is smaller than 5 - 7
print(3 + 2 < 5 - 7)

# print out "What is 3 + 2?" and the result of calculating 3 + 2. Same below
print("What is 3 + 2?", 3 + 2)
print("What is 5 - 7?", 5 - 7)

# print out "Oh, that's why it's False."
print("Oh, that's why it's False.")

# print out "How about some more."
print("How about some more.")

# print "Is it greater?" and the result of calculating 5 > -2
print("Is it greater?", 5 > -2)
print("Is it greater or equal?", 5 >= -2)
print("Is it less or equal?", 5 <= -2)

# Study Drill
## 1: see code above
## 4: just put a .0 after every integer
